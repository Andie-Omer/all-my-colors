        <div class="Areatext" <p>Dear Parent,
            <br><br>
            What do you do when your child has big feelings and doesn't know how to explain?
            <br>
            <br>
            Let colors talk for them! Colors have natural meaning to kids.
            <br><br>
            Using the All My Colors mobile app, your child can choose a bubble of color that shows their mood. If they
            feel like it, they can add a note as well. You can encourage your child's emotional awareness with this
            simple color diary.
            <br><br>
            Start a conversation with color.</p>
